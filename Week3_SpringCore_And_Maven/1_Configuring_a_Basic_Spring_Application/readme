Scenario

Your company is developing a web application for managing a library. You need to use the Spring Framework to handle the backend operations.

Steps

1. Set Up a Spring Project:
- Create a Maven project named `LibraryManagement`.
- Add Spring Core dependencies in the `pom.xml` file.

2. Configure the Application Context:
- Create an XML configuration file named `applicationContext.xml` in the `src/main/resources` directory.
- Define beans for `BookService` and `BookRepository` in the XML file.

3. Define Service and Repository Classes:
- Create a package `com.library.service` and add a class `BookService`.
- Create a package `com.library.repository` and add a class `BookRepository`.

4. Run the Application:
- Create a main class to load the Spring context and test the configuration.

Creating Microservices for account and loan  
In this hands on exercises, we will create two microservices for a bank. One 
microservice for handing accounts and one for handling loans. 
Each microservice will be a specific independent Spring RESTful Webservice 
maven project having it's own pom.xml. The only difference is that, instead of 
having both account and loan as a single application, it is split into two 
different applications. These webservices will be a simple service without any 
backend connectivity.
